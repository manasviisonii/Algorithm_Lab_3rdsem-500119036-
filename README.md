This repository contains implementations of various algorithms as part of the Algorithm Lab exercises for the third semester. Each lab highlights a distinct algorithmic concept, exploring recursive and iterative methods, divide and conquer strategies, and greedy approaches. Below is an overview of each lab:


LAB-1: Binary Search Tree Insertion üå≤

Objective:
Implement both iterative and recursive insertion methods in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and analyze their performance.

Description:
This lab introduces BST insertion using both recursive and iterative techniques. By comparing these methods, we gain insights into their performance differences and efficiency.


LAB-2: Merge Sort and Quick Sort ‚öôÔ∏è

Objective:
Implement and compare the performance of Merge Sort and Quick Sort algorithms based on the divide and conquer principle.

Description:
This lab demonstrates the divide and conquer paradigm through two vital sorting algorithms: Merge Sort and Quick Sort. Using the same dataset for both, we compare their efficiencies to understand their strengths and best applications.


LAB-3: Matrix Multiplication üî¢

Objective:
Compare Strassen's matrix multiplication method with the traditional approach to matrix multiplication.

Description:
We investigate Strassen's method for matrix multiplication and compare it with the standard approach, testing various matrix sizes to observe computational savings where applicable.


LAB-4: Activity Selection Problem üéüÔ∏è

Objective:
Implement the Activity Selection Problem to illustrate the greedy algorithmic approach.

Description:
The Activity Selection Problem is implemented to showcase the greedy approach, aiming to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities. This exercise highlights how a greedy strategy can effectively optimize for maximum selection within constraints.
